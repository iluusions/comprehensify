# Project Todo List

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

1. **Integrate Different Models**
   - Integrate various models instead of only GPT-4o (e.g., LLaMA 3, Phi, Claude 3).
   - Allow users to choose the model they prefer, with more expensive ones costing more.

2. **User Authentication**
   - Implement authentication using Google or username/password.

3. **Fix JSON Formatting Bug**
   - Ensure the JSON object from ChatGPT is always formatted correctly.

4. **Cleanup**
   - Refine the prompts for ChatGPT/models.
   - Improve HTML reading.
   - Remove unnecessary console logs.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced User Features**
   - Add quizzes, annotations/highlights to the webpage.
   - Provide definitions for complex words.

2. **Server-Side Caching**
   - Implement caching for model calls to optimize performance.

3. **Dashboard for Organizers**
   - Create a dashboard for organizers (parents, school districts, teachers) to monitor student performance.

4. **Client-Side Model**
   - Develop a client-side model that sits on the userâ€™s PC, reads the text, etc., making it more cost-effective (e.g., using Phi).

## Side Important Tasks

1. **Make the Paper V1**
   - Develop the first version of the paper.

2. **Explore Code Generation with English**
   - Make another paper on the concept of generating code using English.
   - Organize previous conversations to format them into documentation.
